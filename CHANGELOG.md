## 4.0.1

**Fixes**

- Fix `has_line_info` to not short-circuit when it found lines _without_ line-info.

## 4.0.0

This is a complete rewrite of the crate.
It focuses on two types, `ProguardMapping` and `ProguardMapper`.

**ProguardMapping**

Provides high level metadata about a proguard mapping file, and allows iterating
over the contained `ProguardRecord`s.

This is a replacement for the previous `Parser`. For example,
`Parser::has_line_info()` becomes `ProguardMapping::has_line_info()`.

**ProguardMapper**

Allows re-mapping class names and entire frames, with support for inlined frames.

This is a replacement for the previous `MappingView`, and allows easier
re-mapping of both class-names and complete frames.

`MappingView::find_class("obfuscated").map(Class::class_name)` becomes
`ProguardMapper::remap_class("obfuscated")`, and the
`ProguardMapper::remap_frame` function replaces manually collecting and
processing the results of `Class::get_methods`.

## 3.0.0
